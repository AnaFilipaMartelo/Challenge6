We create a bar chart to analyze Housing Units in San Francisco from 2010 to 2016 and two line plots. One shows Sale Price per Square Foot and Average Gross Rent - 2010-2016 -San Francisco and the other shows Sale Price per Square Foot and Average Gross Rent - 2010-2016 -By Neighborhood. 

Lastly, we create a Neighborhood scatter plot using hvPlot with GeoViews enabled.

Explore the interactive plots and maps to identify potential investment opportunities in the San Francisco real estate market.
